# Machine-Learning-Smart-Home
Make a machine learning smart home that adapts to how you control your lights. Every day, you set the brightness of your lights at various times in the day. In a normal home automation scenario, if you want to make this process iterative, you'd have to setup schedules, groups, scenes, etc. and anytime you want to change something, you'd have to go back and edit everything again. This isn't very smart or practical.  Now my solution around this is to make a learning home which figures out what brightness levels you want to set your lights at and at what hours. It is also adaptable, meaning that if you decide to change the brightness from 80% to 0% at 10pm, you don't have to change the settings for you home automation system, the machine will figure it out for you and just do it.
